- A methodology:
	- A system of methods
	- A guidline for decision-making during the scientific process
	- Data science methodology guides data scienctists in solving complex problems with data

- DS methodology consists of 10 stages and here are the questions to ask at each stage:
	- Business understanding -> analyic approach (define the issue and solution):
 		- What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
	 	- How can you use data to answer the business question?
  - Data requirements -> Data collection -> Data understanding -> Data preparation (get organized around the data)
		- What data do you need to answer the question?
    - Where is the data sourced from, and how will you receive the data?
    - Does the data you collected represent the problem to be solved?
    - What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data
  - Modeling -> Evaluation -> Deployment -> Feedback (Validate your approach and the final design of the data)
  	- When you apply data visualizations, do you see answers that address the business problem?
   	- Does the data model answer the initial business question or must you adjust the data?
    - Can you put the model into practice?
    - Can you get constructive feedback from the data and the stakeholder to answer the business question?

- First step: Business understanding ( Identifies the data sources and variables required to address the business problem )
  - Understand the goal
  - Identifying the objectives that support the goal

- Second step: Analytic approach
	- Pick analytic appraoach based on the question type
   	- If the question is to determine the probabilities of an action: use a predictive model
   	- If the question is to show relationships: use a descriptive model
   	- If the question requires a yes/no answer: use a classification model
  
- Third step: Data Requirements
	- The chosen analytic approach determines the data requirements. Specifically, the analytic methods to be used require certain data content, formats and representations, guided by domain knowledge.
	- Identify the necessary data content, formats, and sources for initial data collection
 
- Fourth step: Data collection
	- When collecting data it is alright to defer (delay) decisions about unavailable data and attempt to accquire it at a later stage
	- Using Data visualization and decriptive statistics to get initial insights about the data.
 	- This step involves collaborating with DBAs and programmer to extract and merge data from various sources
